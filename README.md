My First project is to build a Bike Rental Website.

The users goal from this website is to find suitable bikes they are can rent so they can go on a scenic adventures around the Lough Derg region, whilst fulfilling the physical and mental benefits from cycling.

My goal as a sight owner is to provide a user-friendly website that will enable the user to rent a bike in a straight forward and efficient manner.   I also want to promote my local area and showcase all the attractions in the town that the person renting the bicycles would like to visit.

The requirements I have featured in the website are as follows;

* To Showcase the shop and the services we provide
* Provide information to where we are located
* Links to pages where you can book the bikes you want to rent and book an appointment if you need repairs
* Contact Information showing Location of the store on the map
